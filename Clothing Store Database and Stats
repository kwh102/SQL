--First, I created a table for my clothing store

CREATE TABLE clothing_store (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, item TEXT, quantity INTEGER, price INTEGER, sold_this_week INTEGER);

INSERT INTO clothing_store
VALUES(1, "Shirts", 20, 25, 5);
INSERT INTO clothing_store VALUES (2, "Dresses", 45, 50, 3);
INSERT INTO clothing_store VALUES (3, "Pants", 25, 35, 16);
INSERT INTO clothing_store VALUES (4, "Skirts", 15, 30, 10);
INSERT INTO clothing_store VALUES (5, "Jackets", 5, 60,1);

--Then I wanted to see the items ordered from the least expensive to the most expensive

SELECT * FROM clothing_store ORDER BY price;

--Finally, I wanted to see how many items were sold in one week

SELECT SUM(sold_this_week) FROM clothing_store;
